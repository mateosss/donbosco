Narrator: 

	God, it is said, sends the world saints when they are most needed-not men and women of "general holiness," but specialized experts who fit into the pattern of the times and are capable of giving God's tone to their century.
	And so it was that on August 16, 1815 when one era was closing in Europe with the exile of Napoleon, and the Industrial Revolution was clanging another opened, "a man was sent by God whose name was John." He came to the scrubby stone cottage of Francis and Margaret Bosco on the hills of Becchi, at the foot of the Italian Alps. Two years after John was born, his father died. "A fine healthy baby," the neighbors all agreed, "fit for the soil, to take his father's place on the old homestead." But no one went further than that in predicting the child's future.

John: But where, how?

Jesus: I will give you a Teacher, under whose guidance you will learn and without whose help all knowledge becomes foolishness.

John: But who are you?

Jesus: I am the Son of Her whom your mother has taught you to greet three times a day.

John: My mother told me not to talk to people I don't know unless she gives me permission. So, please tell me your name.

Mary: Look!

Mary: This is your field, this is where you must work. Make yourself humble, steadfast, and strong. And what you will see happen to these animals you will have to do for my children.
